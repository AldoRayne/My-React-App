                                    United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect;
                                    and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in
                                    competition. On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to
                                    partner with counterparts in Muslim-majority countries. </p>
